# graph-clustering-converter

Small converter tool to convert graphs encoded as a csv file with the scheme 
| source_user_id | target_user_id | interaction_type | timestamp |
|----------------|----------------|------------------|-----------|

to a metis file in order to cluster the users based on their interactions.

This is a part of my contributions to the [Efficient Algorithms](https://algorithms.cosy.sbg.ac.at/) research group at the [University of Salzburg](https://plus.ac.at).
